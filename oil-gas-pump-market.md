<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil & Gas Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pump</li><li>Positive Displacement Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Oil & Gas Pump Market comprises two main types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move fluid, making them ideal for applications requiring high flow rates and low viscosity fluids. In contrast, positive displacement pumps work by trapping a fixed amount of fluid and forcing it through the discharge, which is efficient for high-viscosity fluids and precise flow control. Each type serves different operational needs and is essential for various processes in the oil and gas industry.</p></p>
